# json2musicxml

This lib converts from json to [musicXML format](https://www.musicxml.com), which is the quasi standard format for music notation. By using [opensheetmusicdisplay](https://opensheetmusicdisplay.org/) you can quickly render sheet music on the web while keeping it exportable for note editing software.

This project is currently just a working concept but it hopefully will be available as npm module soon.

## Demo

Run ```npm run demo``` to  launch a live editor.
